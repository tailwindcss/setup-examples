# Tailwind CSS Setup Examples

A repository of examples showing how to setup Tailwind in a variety of different frameworks and environments.

Please note that these examples are for the most part contributed and maintained by the community, and we merge them without a ton of review because it seems more helpful to have *something* than nothing. If you notice any issues or inconsistencies across different examples, we welcome all contributions to improve them.

## Contributing

If we're missing you're favorite framework/static site generator/CMS/whatever, we'd love a PR that includes a barebones example of the best way to set up Tailwind in that environment.

Try to keep the examples as simple as humanly possible, ideally there would be two commits:

1. Initializing the default project, usually using some CLI tool provided by the framework (like `vue create my-project` with vue-cli).
2. The minimum necessary changes to add Tailwind to the project.

Please include instructions for the setup process as well, so it's easier for others to follow. [Here's an example](examples/vue-cli/README.md).

Some that we're missing that we'd love to have:

- Ember.js
- Angular
- Gatsby
- Rails
- Django
- Symfony
- Craft CMS
- Drupal
