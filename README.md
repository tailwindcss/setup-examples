# Tailwind CSS Setup Examples

A repository of examples showing how to setup Tailwind in a variety of different frameworks and environments.

## Available Examples

- [create-react-app](https://mikefrancis.dev/blog/create-react-app-tailwind-css)
- [Gatsby](https://mikefrancis.dev/blog/gatsby-tailwind)
- [Next.js](https://mikefrancis.dev/blog/next-js-tailwind-css)
- [vue-cli](examples/vue-cli)

## Requested Examples

If you are experienced with any of these frameworks, we'd love a PR that includes a barebones example of the best way to set up Tailwind in that environment.

Please include instructions for the setup process as well, so it's easier for others to follow. [Here's an example](examples/vue-cli/README.md).

If we're missing you're favorite framework, don't hesitate to PR that either!
